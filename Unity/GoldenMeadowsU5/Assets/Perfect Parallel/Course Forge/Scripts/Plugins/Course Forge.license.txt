You further represent and warrant that the User Generated Content, your submission of that Content, and your granting of rights in that Content does not violate any applicable contract, law or regulation.
Automated Download.  Some of the Software has been designed so that it can be delivered in segments to ensure that the download will be quick and convenient. In such cases, a small piece of software may be installed initially that can then "call out" over the Internet to a web server and complete its installation on your computer at a later time (i) during the installation process, (ii) when you have available bandwidth, or (iii) when you have requested use of a function that requires that portion of the Software.  This mechanism will only be used to complete the installation of the Software you have chosen to install.
Automated Updates.  We may, but are not obligated to, deliver to your computer automated updates, upgrades, modifications, and/or patches to address issues such as security, interoperability, and performance (collectively “Updates”).  You consent to such Updates, and you authorize us to deliver automatically any Update if we believe it is necessary to provide for the continued functionality of the Software.  Your use of the Updates will be governed by this Agreement unless you are asked to agree to new or additional terms and conditions at the time of download or installation.  
Performance and Usage Information.  The Software is configured to report back information automatically for registration purposes and relating to computer errors arising in connection with use of the Software, without notice to you.  Information on your Software configuration settings may be included. This data is sent to us to help diagnose performance issues with, and improve, the Software.  The Software may contain a specific identification number for the purpose of tracking the number of unique instances of the Software in use.
Use and Availability of Open Source Code.  Portions of some of the Software may have been created using source code available through various open source projects. In such cases, the licenses and availability of source code for such components are specified in a copyright notice document delivered with or linked from such Software.
Feedback. You agree that Perfect Parallel may use in any manner, without limitation and for no compensation, all comments, suggestions, complaints and other feedback you may provide relating to the Software.

Upon termination, you must stop all use of the software and must destroy all copies of the Software that are in your possession. All provisions of this Agreement, except for the license grant in Section 3 above, survive the termination of this Agreement.  
Injunctive Relief.  You agree that your breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause us irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate and that we, therefore, may obtain timely injunctive relief to protect our rights under this Agreement in addition to any and all other remedies available to us at law or in equity.
Disclaimer of Warranty.  WE LICENSE THE SOFTWARE “AS IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THIS SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT ITS OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, EFFORT AND COST OF ANY SERVICE AND REPAIR IS WITH YOU.  WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INTERFERENCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR ACCURACY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY US OR BY ANY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF PERFECT PARALLEL SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ANY WARRANTY THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. PERFECT PARALLEL AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE.  IF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY MAY NOT BE DISCLAIMED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THEN SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTY IS LIMITED TO 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU ACQUIRED THE SOFTWARE FROM US OR OUR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR.
Limitation of Liability.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PERFECT PARALLEL OR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, AGENTS OR RESELLERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "PERFECT PARALLEL GROUP") BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF, AND REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED. IN ANY CASE, THE PERFECT PARALLEL GROUP'S ENTIRE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE SUM OF THE FEES YOU PAID FOR THIS LICENSE (IF ANY) AND REPLACEMENT OR PROVISION OF A REASONABLY SIMILAR SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AS DETERMINED AT PERFECT PARALLEL’S SOLE DISCRETION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF PERFECT PARALLEL TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS THE LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN SUCH CASES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
